## 📌 Abstract

Breast tumor classification plays a crucial role in early detection and treatment planning for breast cancer. In recent years, deep learning models have shown remarkable success in image-based medical diagnosis. This study focuses on improving breast tumor classification using **fine-tuned hyperparameter training** of deep learning models.

By optimizing key parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, the classification accuracy of models like ResNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet and VGG is enhanced. The proposed approach leverages advanced techniques such as **transfer learning, data augmentation, and hyperparameter optimization algorithms** (Bayesian Optimization along with Population-Based Training) to achieve robust performance on breast cancer datasets.

The proposed method achieves **98.46% accuracy** while classifying breast cancer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to conventional approaches, making the fine-tuned models more suitable for **clinical applications**.

## 🏥 Medical Context & Motivation

**Critical Healthcare Challenge:**  
Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, with approximately **90,000 deaths reported annually** in India alone. The 5-year survival rate in India is approximately **60%**, significantly lower than in high-income countries due to delayed diagnosis, limited access to healthcare, and lack of awareness.

**Why Deep Learning?**  
Early detection programs and improved healthcare infrastructure are critical to improving outcomes. Deep learning models can assist radiologists in accurate and rapid diagnosis, potentially saving lives through earlier intervention.

**Our Contribution:**  
We propose a **modified ResNet-50 architecture** with hybrid Bayesian optimization that achieves state-of-the-art performance on breast ultrasound image classification, making it suitable for real-world clinical deployment.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### **Enhanced ResNet-50 Architecture**
- **Base Model:** ResNet-50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Enhancements:** Dilated convolutions + Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks
- **Optimization:** Bayesian Optimization + Population-Based Training (PBT)
- **Training Strategy:** Transfer learning with medical imaging fine-tuning

### **Key Technical Innovations**

#### 1. **Modified ResNet-50 Framework**
Our enhanced architecture introduces several critical improvements:

#### 2. **Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization**
Revolutionary approach combining:
- **Bayesian Optimization:** Efficient exploration of hyperparameter space
- **Population-Based Training:** Dynamic real-time parameter adjustment
- **Medical Benefits:** 2-3% accuracy improvement, 20-30% faster convergence
- **Clinical Impact:** Faster training enables rapid model updates for new data

#### 3. **Residual Learning Enhancement**
Mathematical foundation for our improvements:
```
F(x) = H(x) - x  (residual learning)
H(x) = F(x) + x  (identity mapping)
```
Where layers learn the residual F(x) rather than the full mapping H(x), enabling deeper networks crucial for complex medical image analysis.

### **Pipeline Overview**
```
Breast Ultrasound Images → Preprocessing → Data Augmentation → 
Modified ResNet-50 → Bayesian Optimization → 
Population-Based Training → Clinical Model → Medical Evaluation
```
